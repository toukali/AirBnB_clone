# AirBnB Clone : The  Console
#### A command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building the first full web application: the  **AirBnB clone**. 

This step is important because it will be used to build with all other of the following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

#### What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

-   Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Update attributes of an object
-   Destroy an object
